Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a kind girl named Lily. 
She loved exploring the forest near her home. One day, she found a wounded bird and decided to take care of it. 
With patience and love, Lily helped the bird recover, and soon it was able to fly again. 
The bird chirped happily and flew away, but every morning, it returned to sing a song for Lily as a thank-you.
